A simple web app where a user can:
- Create an account (Devise)
- Perform the all CRUD operations on his recipes, while getting nutritional information about each ingredient and recipe created
- Save to favourites
- Choose to publish or not his recipes
- Search recipes by recipe name or ingredient (ElasticSearch with Searchkick and Bonsai gems)

The app is still under development and some features might still be incomplete or unavailable, however, here it is if you wish to take a look:

Note: After signing up the user is allowed to use the app for 2 days before having to confirm it's email.
Note 2: All recipe and ingredient data is currently being produced by the Faker gem so it's extremely inaccurate. This will be fixed soon.

Bug reports are very welcome! Thank you in advance!
