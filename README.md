A simple web app where a user can create an account to add/store his recipes, while getting nutritional information about each ingredient and recipe created. The user will be able to publish his recipes, search in the Recipe Main list and adding to his favourites. 

The nutritional data (per 100g of Ingredient) being used at the moment does not correspond to the reality. An API will be created to provide it, after the main structure of the app is completed.
